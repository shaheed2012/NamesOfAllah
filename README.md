Privacy policy
Welcome to the Names of Allah app for Android!

This is a free Android app, with no advertisements, developed by Shaheed Mahomed. 

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. This app does not allow you to create data in it and therefore all data is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Shaheed Mahomed
